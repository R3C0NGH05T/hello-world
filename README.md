# hello-world
recon ghost is my hacker name, I am mostly focused on network security and penetration testing networks, web pages and a little bit of programming code. My favorite OS type is Linux and my two favorite linux distros are Parrot OS Security and Kali Linux. I have fun hacking my OWN wifi networks, finding and/or creating backdoors in code, finding and/or creating exploits in Windows OS be it reverse tcp, sql injections, MITM attacks, SAM password cracking and so on.
